    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    
    <img src="images/me1.png" alt="rajat's image">
    <p>Hi everyone myself Rajat Khatri , I'm a engineering student in Cochin university of science and technology.Apart from engineering i'm a self taught programmer and passionate about technology</p>    

    <p>Below are some of the tech. things which i like the most</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Machine Learning & Deeplearning</li>
        <li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Automation</li>

    </ul>

    <p>I started my computer science carrer in the 2018 with intrests in cyber security , within some months i realised that this is not of my intreses
        so i switched to explore the different fields. When i was taking the overview of different different technologies i encounterd with the machine Learning
        which catched my eye , not because of market hype but because here i found the true meaning of maths which i , and probably you also , was learning from 
        childhood. Like what a differentation really  is , what a slope is and many more exiting stuff!! .
    </p>

    <p>Some people say ML/DL is fancy stuff and you will not get a job because you are a fresher 
        Yeh it is true only in the case when you not have enough amount of knowledge and practice. I worked with ML 7-8 months and i feel that i wil be a 
        Machine learning engineer one day. 
        <br>
        During covid19 , my time was wasted and now i m in  NOV 2020 and in delema that what i learn for placemnts . Should i continue with ML ? or go for Full stack web dev?
<br>
This delema came because i stopped learning and wasted a lot time . One more thing was not doing the DSA is affecting my probleam solving skills. So i finally decide to 
do work on my probleam solving skills with Full stack web dev (while writing this first website) and regarding machine learning i decided that i will continue that but not 
as major for now, as soon as i get idea for ML project then i will do that . So thats all for the first day ! Signing off kush---------
